## Project Overview 📜 📈
In this project, I analyzed a housing dataset to build predictive models for house prices. As a Data Analyst for a Real Estate Investment Trust, I utilized data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling techniques to generate insights and build predictive models. Their performance was evaluated with the R² scores, showcasing the practical application of data science in real-world scenarios. 

## About the Dataset 📂
The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, USA, including Seattle, for homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. You can access the dataset here: [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).

## Project Goals 🎯
**1\. Data Cleaning**: Addressing unnecessary columns and managing missing values.

**2\. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  Producing visualizations such as box plots and regression plots, along with statistical summaries.

**3\. Feature Engineering**: Applying polynomial transformations. 

**4\. Modeling**: Building Ridge regression models and evaluating their performance through R² scores.
